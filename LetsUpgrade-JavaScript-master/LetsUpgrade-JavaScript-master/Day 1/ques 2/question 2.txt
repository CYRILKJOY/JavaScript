Var



The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, we can initialize the value of that variable.
The scope of a JavaScript variable declared outside the function is global.

Example: var a =10;

  var a =10;
  console.log(a);  
  if(true){
   var a=20;
   console.log(a); 
  }
  console.log(a); 
}


Let


The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var, in that we can optionally initialize the variable.
The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used.


Example: let a =10;
function nodeSimplified(){
  let a =10;
  console.log(a); 
  if(true){
   let a=20;
   console.log(a); 
  }
  console.log(a); 
}


Const


const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. 
The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.

Example: const a =10;

  const MY_VARIABLE =10;
  console.log(MY_VARIABLE);
